####When should we and should we not use Redux?

Well, states management is one of the crucial part when developing a react application. However global state (eg. Redux) doesn’t really solve the real problem, global state is rapidly changing so it will cause some re-rendering issue if we don’t handle it in a proper way. As react developer I need to carefully define a state, should it define inside component or should it be on global state or could it be stored to the local storage instead. It’s a common mistake though, in react apps, all the data from the backend stores to the global state. It will cost heavy in-memory usage when the apps running. So based on my experience, that is the wrong way. Basically, we need to put the data in the right place like local storage so only keep the uniq id inside the global state. Then when the component needs the data to display, creates a selector to querying the data by uniq id from local storage.
