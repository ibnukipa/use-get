####If you were working on an application that was rendering a page/screen very slowly, how would you go about investigating and fixing the issue?

in JS world, multithreading is a myth, so basically check what are the process that happening in that page / screen, check also the side effect process, especially the network process. Then, check the re-rendering issue, is there any infinite re-rendering? especially when using the class based component and also check the props, it’s quite tricky to passed the non-primitive type variable as a props because that props will be treated as new every time the parent do the re-rendering. That’s why I always consider to use function based component. In function based component, there is useCallback and useMemo to avoid the child to re-rendering.
